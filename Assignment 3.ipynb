    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown\n",
    "allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text\n",
    "format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, \"Markdown\" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax;\n",
    "and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text\n",
    "formatting to HTML. See the [Syntax][] page for details pertaining to\n",
    "Markdown's formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the\n",
    "online [Dingus][].\n",
    "\n",
    "  [syntax]: /projects/markdown/syntax\n",
    "  [dingus]: /projects/markdown/dingus\n",
    "\n",
    "The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make\n",
    "it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted\n",
    "document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking\n",
    "like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While\n",
    "Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML\n",
    "filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown's\n",
    "syntax is the format of plain text email.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to get a feel for Markdown's formatting syntax is simply\n",
    "to look at a Markdown-formatted document. For example, you can view\n",
    "the Markdown source for the article text on this page here:\n",
    "<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/index.text>\n",
    "\n",
    "(You can use this '.text' suffix trick to view the Markdown source for\n",
    "the content of each of the pages in this section, e.g. the\n",
    "[Syntax][s_src] and [License][l_src] pages.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  [s_src]: /projects/markdown/syntax.text\n",
    "  [l_src]: /projects/markdown/license.text\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is free software, available under a BSD-style open source\n",
    "license. See the [License] [pl] page for more information.\n",

    "Discussion List <a id=\"discussion-list\" />\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "I've set up a public [mailing list for discussion about Markdown] [ml].\n",
    "Any topic related to Markdown -- both its formatting syntax and\n",
    "its software -- is fair game for discussion. Anyone who is interested\n",
    "is welcome to join.\n",
    "\n",

    "Installation and Requirements <a id=\"install\" />\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown requires Perl 5.6.0 or later. Welcome to the 21st Century.\n",
    "Markdown also requires the standard Perl library module [Digest::MD5]\n",
    "[md5], which is probably already installed on your server.\n",

    "### Movable Type ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown works with Movable Type version 2.6 or later (including\n",
    "Movable Type 3.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Copy the \"Markdown.pl\" file into your Movable Type \"plugins\"\n",
    "\tdirectory. The \"plugins\" directory should be in the same directory\n",
    "\tas \"mt.cgi\"; if the \"plugins\" directory doesn't already exist, use\n",
    "\tyour FTP program to create it. Your installation should look like\n",
    "\tthis:\n",
    "\n",
    "        (mt home)/plugins/Markdown.pl\n",

    "3.\tIf you also install SmartyPants 1.5 (or later), Markdown will\n",
    "\toffer a second text formatting option: \"Markdown With\n",
    "\tSmartyPants\". This option is the same as the regular \"Markdown\"\n",
    "\tformatter, except that it automatically uses SmartyPants to create\n",
    "\ttypographically correct curly quotes, em-dashes, and ellipses. See\n",

    "### Blosxom ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown works with Blosxom version 2.0 or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Rename the \"Markdown.pl\" plug-in to \"Markdown\" (case is\n",
    "    important). Movable Type requires plug-ins to have a \".pl\"\n",
    "    extension; Blosxom forbids it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Copy the \"Markdown\" plug-in file to your Blosxom plug-ins folder.\n",
    "    If you're not sure where your Blosxom plug-ins folder is, see the\n",
    "    Blosxom documentation for information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  That's it. The entries in your weblog will now automatically be\n",
    "\tprocessed by Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tIf you'd like to apply Markdown formatting only to certain\n",
    "\tposts, rather than all of them, Markdown can optionally be used in\n",
    "\tconjunction with Blosxom's [Meta][] plug-in. First, install the\n",
    "\tMeta plug-in. Next, open the Markdown plug-in file in a text\n",
    "\teditor, and set the configuration variable `$g_blosxom_use_meta`\n",
    "\tto 1. Then, simply include a \"`meta-markup: Markdown`\" header line\n",

    "with BBEdit 5.1 or later and MacPerl 5.6.1 on Mac OS 8.6 or later. If\n",
    "you're running Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), you may need to install the\n",
    "Perl module [Digest::MD5] [md5] from CPAN; Digest::MD5 comes\n",
    "pre-installed on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Copy the \"Markdown.pl\" file to appropriate filters folder in your\n",
    "\t\"BBEdit Support\" folder. On Mac OS X, this should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "        BBEdit Support/Unix Support/Unix Filters/\n",

    "By default, Markdown produces XHTML output for tags with empty elements.\n",
    "E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br />\n",

    "        ... put your entry content here ...\n",
    "    </MTMarkdownOptions>\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to use MTMarkdownOptions is probably to put the\n",
    "opening tag right after your `<body>` tag, and the closing tag right\n",
    "before `</body>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To suppress Markdown processing in a particular template, i.e. to\n",

    "\n",
    "Use the `--html4tags` command-line switch to produce HTML output from a\n",
